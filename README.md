Metapop-Disease
===============

- Author: Clint Leach

Project to investigate the role of pathogen environmental reservoirs and habitat heterogeneity on disease dynamics in a meapopulation.  This work is done in collaboration with my advisor, Colleen Webb, and Paul Cross of USGS.  

Note that the included code represents only the most recent iterations (i.e. those on which the publication is based).

The directories are:
- Code = R scripts that define and run the simulation and analyze the resulting data.
- Data = *.csv* files generated by code.
- Manuscript = draft of manuscript for publication.

See README files within Code and Data directories for additional information.
