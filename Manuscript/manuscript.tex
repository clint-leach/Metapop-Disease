\begin{abstract} 
The distribution of habitat quality plays an important role in the dynamics of wildlife metapopulations, with the expectation that high quality habitat serves to stabilize and maintain occupancy (REF).  However, the costs and benefits of different quality habitat might be modulated, or even reversed, by the presence of an environmentally persistent pathogen.  The presence of environmental pathogen reservoirs on high quality habitat may lead to the creation of ecological traps, wherein host individuals preferentially colonize high quality habitat, but are then exposed to increased infection risk.  We explored this possibility through the development of a stochastic patch occupancy model, where we varied the pathogen's virulence, transmission rate, and environmental persistence as well as the distribution of habitat quality in the host metapopulation.  This model suggests that for certain (delete or explain what the certain refers to) pathogens, high quality habitat can serve as an ecological trap, and can be detrimental to host persistence relative to low quality habitat.  This inversion of the relative roles of high and low quality habitat highlights the importance of considering the interaction between spatial structure and pathogen transmission when managing wildlife populations exposed to an environmentally persistent pathogen.

PCC: abstract reads well. You could consider putting in a few more details. e.g. can you characterize the conditions/parameter space that creates the traps rather than just saying they may exist.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Many wildlife diseases are caused by pathogens that can persist, and remain infectious, for long periods of time in the environment.  Examples include chronic wasting disease (\cite{Miller2006}), anthrax (\cite{Dragon1995}), plague (\cite{Eisen2008}), and white nose syndrome (\cite{Lindner2011}), among others (PCC: may need latin names, could include chytrid? I think it is also potentially noteworthy that these pathogens also seem to be particularly notorious in wildlife....therefore this is a big deal).  This environmental persistence creates environmental pathogen reservoirs from which susceptible hosts can become infected without direct contact with an infectious individual.  This additional transmission pathway can have important consequences for disease dynamics, with models showing that increased environmental longevity generally facilitates increased pathogen persistence and spread relative to direct transmission alone (\cite{Almberg2011}, \cite{Sharp2011}, \cite{Breban2009}). 

Since environmental transmission is spatially explicit (i.e. environmental reservoirs can only infect local residents), its role in disease dynamics may further depend on the spatial structure of the host population.  In particular, we expect that host population structure and movement will be influenced by heterogeneity in quality among the habitat patches in a metapopulation.  Indeed, the quality of a habitat patch can affect its extinction and colonization rates, as well as its contribution to the colonization of other empty patches (\cite{Moilanen1998}).  These processes may influence how a pathogen spreads, where environmental pathogen reservoirs get established, and the resulting effects on host occupancy and population size.  

We expect that high quality habitat patches, which support greater host density and traffic than lower quality habitat, might be more likely to form pathogen reservoirs and support consistently infectious populations.  As these reservoirs are undetectable to the host, we predict that high quality patches will continue to attract -- and infect -- susceptible immigrants, effectively creating an ecological trap (\cite{Almberg2011}) (PCC: probably need a different reference for your first reference to "ecological trap").  In addition, the greater traffic through high quality patches may further facilitate pathogen spread by positioning high quality patches as metapopulation-scale superspreaders (\cite{Paull2012}).  Similarly, we expect that low quality patches will be less likely to develop pathogen reservoirs and may serve as refuges where susceptible hosts can escape infection.  

Many, if not all, of the pathogens listed above affect spatially structured host populations (e.g. plague in prairie dog colonies, \cite{George2013}), and thus understanding how pathogen transmission interacts with patterns of habitat quality is critical to managing disease in these systems.  In this study, we explore how a pathogen's traits interact with the distribution of habitat quality to influence pathogen spread and host occupancy.  We specifically focus on the relative importance of high and low quality habitats to host persistence in the presence of pathogens with different levels of environmental longevity. 

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}

\subsection{Stochastic patch occupancy model}


To address the above questions, we developed a stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) in which each patch can be in one of three possible states: occupied by susceptible hosts (S), occupied by infectious hosts (I), and unoccupied by the host ($\emptyset$).  State transitions are governed by host colonization, extinction, and infection rates, where a susceptible population can become infectious either through direct contact with infectious immigrants, or through a local environmental pathogen reservoir (Table~\ref{transitions}).

We assume that the host population size supported by a patch is proportional to its quality ($A_i$), and that disease-induced mortality reduces the size of infectious populations by a factor of $\nu$.  Building on the framework developed by \cite{Hanski2003} then, the rates at which patch \emph{i}, with quality $A_i$, is colonized by susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively, is given by its connectivity:
\begin{align}
C_{Si} &= A_i^{\xi_{im}} \sum_{i\neq j }\phi(S_j)A_j^{\xi_{em}}\exp(-D d_{ij}),\\
C_{Ii} &= A_i^{\xi_{im}} \sum_{i\neq j }\phi(I_j)(\nu A_j) ^{\xi_{em}}\exp(-D d_{ij}),
\label{connectivity}
\end{align}

PCC: not sure I understand why nothing is a function of time.

where $\phi(X_j)$ is an indicator function that is $1$ if patch $j$ is in state $X$ and is $0$ otherwise; $\xi_{im}$ and $\xi_{em}$ control how rates of immigration and emigration, respectively, scale with patch quality; $D$ is the inverse of mean dispersal distance; and $d_{ij}$ is the distance between patches $i$ and $j$  (PCC: not sure I would say $d_{ij}$ is a distance here when 2 paragraphs down you set $d_ij = 1$).  Essentially, $C_{Xi}$ sums the colonization effort (or propagule pressure) from all patches in state $X$ to focal patch $i$.  

The state-dependent extinction rates of populations on patch $i$ are then given by:
\begin{align}
E_{Si} & =\frac{\mu}{A_i^\alpha},\\
E_{Ii} & = \frac{\mu}{(\nu A_i) ^ \alpha}
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is the extinction rate of a patch of unit quality, and $\alpha$ controls how extinction rate scales with population size.  When an infectious population goes extinct, we assume that the hosts leave behind an infectious pathogen reservoir on the patch.  

Susceptible populations are infected via direct contact with infectious colonists at rate $\delta C_{Ii}$, where $\delta$ is the direct transmission probability.  In addition, environmental transmission can take place when a susceptible population occupies a previously infected patch, and occurs at rate:
\begin{equation}
\gamma(\tau_i)=\gamma_0exp(-r\tau_{i}),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_0$ is the initial infection rate of the pathogen reservoir, $\tau_{i}$ is the time since last infectious occupancy ($\tau_{i} = \infty$, and thus $\gamma(\tau_i) = 0$, if the patch has never been occupied by infectious hosts), and $r$ is the pathogen's decay rate in the environment (determined by the pathogen's environmental longevity).

\subsection{Model parameterization}

The model was parameterized  according to the following assumptions (Table~\ref{params}). (1) The rate of emigration from a patch increases with population size, while the extinction rate of a patch decreases with populations size ($\xi_{im}=0.5$, $\alpha=1$, \cite{Hanski2003}).  (2) Migrants preferentially select high quality habitat, that is, high quality patches attract more colonists than low quality patches ($\xi_{em}=0.5$, \cite{Hanski2003}, though we relax this below).  (3)  Connectivity among patches is determined entirely by quality ($d_{ij}=1$ for all $i \neq j$).  In addition to these assumptions, parameters were chosen so that without infection, approximately 0.75 of the metapopulation was occupied ($\mu = 0.1$, $D=5$).  To explore the dynamics of a range of possible pathogens, disease induced mortality ($\nu$), probability of direct infection ($\delta$), and environmental longevity (representing the half-life of the pathogen's infectivity in the environment) were varied over a range of possible values.

The parameterization above assumes that all patches are equally accessible from all other patches (i.e. are separated by distance 1).  To examine the effects of a more rigid spatial structure, we also implemented a model with patches arranged in a square lattice such that each patch is only accessible from its four neighboring patches (in which case, average migration distance was adjusted to $D = 2$ to maintain roughly equivalent occupancy).  

\subsection{Simulation studies}

To explore the relative influence of low and high quality habitat on host and pathogen dynamics, we simulated the spread of a range of pathogens in metapopulations with patch quality distributions shifted towards either high or low quality habitat (PCC: while maintaining the same initial occupancy?).
These two distributions were chosen to have equal variance and an overlapping core of patches around unit quality to roughly simulate alternative management actions that favor expansion (PCC: reword management actions that favor expansion) to include either additional high or low quality habitat (with qualities ranging from 0.76 to 1.77, and from 0.23 to 1.24 respectively).  
We then implemented a full-factorial design on each quality distribution in which the pathogen's disease-induced mortality ($\nu$) and probability of direct infection ($\delta$) were each varied over 10 values (ranging from 0.1 to 1, and 0 to 0.9, respectively).  In addition, pathogen longevity was varied over 3 values (ranging from 0.3 to 3 times the expected residence time of a healthy population on a unit quality patch, i.e., 10 units of time).

For each simulation -- 100 replicates for each combination of disease (determined by $\nu$, $\delta$, and longevity), habitat quality distribution (high or low), and landscape structure (fully connected or lattice), qualities for 100 patches were drawn from a uniform distribution on the given habitat quality range (above). In each case, an entirely susceptible population was simulated until it reached an approximate steady state, at which point a randomly chosen occupied patch was infected.  The state of the metapopulation was then tracked for 5000 time steps.  We recorded the proportion of patches in each state at the end of each simulation and also computed the mean effective population size of susceptible and infectious hosts over the last 500 time steps of the simulation (assuming an effective population size of $A_i$ for patches that are occupied and susceptible and $\nu A_i$ for occupied infectious patches).    

To more carefully explore the potential for high quality habitat to serve as infectious traps, we performed an additional simulation experiment in which we varied the effect of habitat quality on immigration rate by choosing different values for $\xi_{im}$ (with $\xi_{im} = 0.5$ indicating preference for high quality habitat, and  $\xi_{im} = 0$ indicating that migrants select all patches with equal probability).  To isolate the effects of habitat preference and its interaction with pathogen longevity in these simulations, we fixed the direct transmission probability ($\delta = 0.3$), disease induced mortality ($\nu = 0.2$), landscape structure (fully connected), and the patch quality distribution (with patches evenly spaced over the full range of qualities explored in the simulation above).  We performed 100 replicate simulations for each set of model parameters (three values of pathogen longevity and two values of $\xi_{im}$) and recorded the proportion of time each patch spent occupied by infectious hosts (as a measure of disease risk and the corresponding fitness costs) and the final total effective host population size.

Continuous time stochastic simulations of the above model were implemented in the R language (\cite{R2014}) using the Gillespie algorithm (\cite{Gillespie1977}).  Code is available at \url{https://github.com/clint-leach/Metapop-Disease}.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

A wide range of disease dynamics were observed over the range of pathogens and habitat quality distributions explored.  
Epidemic outcome was influenced most strongly by disease induced mortality, with low disease-induced mortality (i.e. high $\nu$) facilitating pandemic dynamics (in which no susceptible host populations persist), and very high disease-induced mortality (i.e. low $\nu$) facilitating disease-free or endemic dynamics (Fig~\ref{endemic}). 
Pathogens with higher environmental longevities were generally able to persist (PCC: careful on word choice between persist and invade) and spread more easily, even with high disease-induced morality (Fig~\ref{endemic}(c, f)).  
The distribution of habitat quality in the metapopulation also played an important role in determining disease dynamics.  Increasing overall habitat quality facilitated pandemic spread for a larger range of pathogens (Fig~\ref{endemic}, a-c vs. d-f).
Metapopulations with a lattice structure exhibited qualitatively similar patterns, but with generally more limited pathogen spread and larger regions of endemic dynamics (Supplement).

For a wide range of parameter values, high quality patch distributions had a net positive effect on total host population size relative to low quality distributions despite generally facilitating pathogen spread (red shaded regions in Fig~\ref{highvlow}).  (PCC: while true, one could also say: for the cases where the host and pathogen both persist there was a wide range of parameter values where low quality habitats supported more hosts.  Essentially, I'm intersecting Fig. 1 and 2, excluding the regions of the parameter space where the host or pathogen goes extinct (which is most of the red region in Fig 2). This is a very different sort of take home message. This is just a change of spin compared to how you phrase the paragraph.)
In the case of pathogens that were unable to persist due to high disease-induced mortality and weak transmission, high quality habitat distributions supported larger host populations than low quality distributions due to the greater stability and connectivity afforded by high quality habitat (bottom left corner of the panels in Fig~\ref{highvlow}). 
Similarly, when low disease-induced mortality and high transmission (from either environmental or direct transmission) allowed a pathogen to spread widely (i.e. at a pandemic level) in both habitat quality distributions, high quality distributions again supported larger host populations than low quality distributions (top portion of panels in Fig~\ref{highvlow}).

However, for pathogens falling between these extremes (e.g. with intermediate disease-induced mortality), low quality habitat was a net benefit to the host, supporting larger total population sizes than high quality habitat (blue regions of Fig ~\ref{highvlow}). (PCC: Yes, may want to lead with this.)
The spread of these pathogens was strongly influenced by the habitat quality distribution, with low quality habitat limiting disease spread and better maintaining susceptible occupancy relative to high quality habitat (Fig~\ref{popsizes}, Supplemental).
In these cases, the more widespread disease-induced mortality faced by hosts on high quality habitat distributions results in smaller total population sizes than on low quality habitat.
As pathogen longevity increases, this range of pathogens for which low quality habitat is beneficial to the host population becomes smaller, with this benefit apparent only for the most virulent pathogens.
Again, metapopulations with a lattice structure displayed similar patterns (Supplement).

To better understand the mechanisms behind these effects, we further examined within patch infection dynamics for a pathogen in this intermediate range (again with $\nu = 0.2$ and $\delta = 0.3$).  
Because of their lower extinction rate and higher recolonization rate, high quality patches supported more consistent occupancy than low quality patches (Fig~\ref{simvis}).  
However, disease risk, measured by the proportion of time a patch spent occupied by infectious hosts, increased with patch quality, an effect that became more pronounced as pathogen longevity increased (Fig~\ref{pinfection}).
Indeed, as an epidemic progressed, high quality patches increasingly supported infectious occupants, while low quality patches supported infectious hosts only briefly and infrequently (Fig~\ref{simvis}).  
Thus, from the perspective of a migrant individual, colonizing high quality habitat posed increased disease risk, with the preferential selection of high quality habitat (i.e. $\xi_{im} = 0.5$) increasing this disease risk further (Fig~\ref{pinfection}, a-c vs. d-f).
Moreover, preferential selection of high quality habitat had dramatic consequences for the stability of the host metapopulation when the pathogen is long-lived in the environment, increasing extinction risk substantially compared to random habitat selection (i.e. $\xi_{em} = 0$, Fig~\ref{pext}).

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion} 

This work demonstrates that the distribution of habitat quality in a metapopulation can have substantial impacts on the dynamics of a variety of environmentally transmitted pathogens and the resulting size and stability of the host population.  
These impacts are driven largely by the interaction between pathogen traits (i.e. disease-induced mortality, environmental and direct transmission rates) and the colonization and extinction rates of high and low quality habitat.
 
The findings that low quality habitat can inhibit disease spread while high quality habitat can enhance it suggest the presence of a trade-off between processes that facilitate metapopulation stability at the expense of disease spread, and processes that hinder disease spread at the expense of metapopulation stability.
In this light, this work expands on previous studies of disease spread in a homogeneous metapopulation that focused on movement rate as the driver of this trade-off, with increased movement both improving metapopulation stability and increasing disease spread (\cite{Hess1996}, \cite{Gog2002}, \cite{Park2012}).  
Shifting the patch quality distribution towards high quality habitat in our model is  conceptually similar to increasing movement in these models.
And, as in these models, the net consequences of this trade-off for the host metapopulation depend on the traits of the pathogen.
Broadly, we can divide the observed dynamics into three different scenarios: pathogen traits produce very weak pathogen spread and high quality habitat is a net benefit; pathogen traits facilitate intermediate/endemic pathogen spread and low quality habitat is a net benefit; and pathogen traits produce easy/pandemic pathogen spread and high quality habitat is again a net benefit.  

\subsection*{Pathogens for which high quality habitat increases host population}

In the first of these scenarios, when pathogens have high disease-induced mortality and weak transmission (bottom left of panels in Figs~\ref{endemic}, \ref{highvlow}), pathogen spread is so limited that habitat quality has little effect on epidemic dynamics.
As a result, high quality patches are a net benefit to the host metapopulation relative to low quality habitat, because their connectivity and stability facilitate larger total population sizes with little additional pathogen spread.

Similarly, in the third scenario, when the pathogen spreads easily as a result of low disease-induced mortality and high transmission (upper portions of panels in Figs~\ref{endemic}, \ref{highvlow}), high quality habitat is again a net benefit to the total host population size.  
Under these conditions, habitat quality again has a limited effect on epidemic dynamics, as the pathogen spreads easily enough to overwhelm any metapopulation structure.
Here then, the benefit of high quality habitat relative to low quality derives primarily from its ability to better maintain metapopulation stability in the face of widespread disease-induced mortality.

\subsection*{Pathogens for which high quality habitat decreases host population}

However, in the second scenario, where the pathogen's traits facilitate intermediate spread (i.e. at an endemic level), the distribution of habitat quality exerts a large influence on epidemic dynamics, with consequences for the overall host population size.
In particular, the ability of these pathogens to persist and spread is influenced substantially by the colonization and extinction rates of high and low quality habitat, and the contrasting roles that these habitat types play in the metapopulation.
 
Because high quality habitat supports larger host population sizes, host populations on high quality habitat are less susceptible to environmental stochasticity and thus experience less frequent extinction events.
Due to this additional stability, high quality habitat is better able to both maintain a consistent pool of susceptible hosts to which infection can spread, and support infectious host populations under disease-induced mortality. 
As a result, the probability of infection (i.e. proportion of time occupied by infectious hosts) increases with patch quality (Fig~\ref{pinfection}).
From the perspective of a migrant susceptible host then, selection of high quality habitat leads to increased disease risk relative to other habitats, either because the patch is likely already occupied by infectious hosts, or because the local susceptible hosts are likely to soon become infected (either through the presence of an environmental reservoir or direct contact).

Thus, if high quality habitat is preferred by migrants (i.e. $\xi_{em} > 0$), it becomes an ecological trap, that is, preferentially selected habitat that reduces fitness relative to other habitats (\cite{Robertson2006}).
This fitness cost (i.e. the disease risk) becomes more severe as pathogen longevity increases, reflecting the more prominent role of environmental transmission on high quality habitat.
Moreover, the preferential selection of high quality habitat further exacerbates the increase in disease risk with habitat quality (Fig~\ref{pinfection}) by increasing the risk of direct transmission from infectious migrants also selecting high quality habitat.
This echoes results from the contact network literature that show that highly connected nodes have higher infection risk (\cite{Christley2005}, \cite{Keeling2005}).

The relatively low extinction rate on high quality patches, and the resulting increased probability of infection, helps to create a relatively stable platform from which the pathogen can spread through the rest of the metapopulation.
Indeed, for pathogens with traits in this intermediate range, high quality patches are effectively metapopulation scale superspreaders (\cite{Lloyd-Smith2005}, \cite{Paull2012}).  
This helps to maintain infectious occupancy throughout the metapopulation, which, when coupled with preference for high quality habitat, feeds back on high quality patches to ensure a steady stream of infectious colonists.
These infectious colonists then help to maintain the environmental reservoir and the trap effect.  
Thus, through these two interacting mechanisms -- the trap and superspreader effects -- the presence of high quality patches serves to significantly increase pathogen spread, even for more virulent pathogens (Fig~\ref{endemic}, \ref{popsizes}).
The consequences of the concomitant widespread disease-induced mortality outweigh the positive consequences of increased metapopulation connectivity and stability, leading to a net decrease in total host population size on high quality habitat distributions (Fig~\ref{highvlow}, \ref{popsizes}).  

In contrast to high quality habitat, low quality patches help to limit pathogen spread and increase susceptible occupancy (Fig~\ref{endemic}, \ref{popsizes}). 
Even though individual low quality patches, due to their high extinction rates and low colonization rates, are unable to support consistent occupancy (Fig~\ref{simvis}), the presence of low quality habitat facilitates susceptible persistence for a greater range of pathogens (Fig~\ref{endemic}).  
This phenomenon represents the other side of the role played by high quality patches in that low quality patches are relatively unstable (i.e. low population sizes and high extinction rates) and thus do not support infectious populations for long.
Since they are infrequently colonized (when high quality habitat is preferentially selected, $\xi_{em} > 0$), the environmental reservoir left behind by these infectious populations likely decays before it has the opportunity to infect new susceptible colonists.  
As a result, low quality patches effectively represent a dead-end for the pathogen, reducing the number of patches from which it can spread, and allowing susceptible hosts to more easily persist and avoid infection.
By preventing the widespread disease-induced mortality observed in high quality habitat distributions, low quality distributions are then able to maintain larger host population sizes (Fig~\ref{endemic}, \ref{popsizes}).

Thus, for pathogens with traits that facilitate this intermediate level of spread, we see a reversal of the relative importance of high and low quality habitat for overall host metapopulation stability.
Here, rather than serving as sources that increase host population size, we see that high quality patches become sinks.  
More importantly, they become ecological traps, which can be even more detrimental to the overall population (\cite{Kristan2003}).  
Indeed, we see that the combination of the trap effect (i.e. host preference for high quality habitat) along with an environmentally long-lived pathogen can have severe consequences for metapopulation stability, substantially increasing the risk of host extinction (Fig~\ref{pext}).
From a management perspective, it is critical to understand this shift in the effect of habitat quality, as previous theoretical work suggests that management should focus on maintaining patches where conditions are most favorable for the host (\cite{Strasser2010}). 
Generally, this means that managers should focus on maintaining high quality habitat, but Strasser et al. (2010) show that stochastic disturbance (e.g. disease-induced mortality) can lead to cases where focusing on low quality habitat is more effective in increasing population growth rate.
Similarly, our model suggests that in some cases, low quality patch distributions, by hindering the spread of the pathogen and providing refuges for susceptible hosts, can maintain larger total host populations than high quality distributions.  


\subsection*{Conclusions}  

This partitioning of pathogen dynamics into three regions based on whether high quality habitat is a net benefit or detriment to the host metapopulation echoes the work of (\cite{Hess1996}, \cite{Gog2002}, \cite{Park2012}).
In particular, for a given pathogen, Hess (\cite{Hess1996}) similarly identified three regions of disease dynamics which determined whether increased movement had a positive or negative effect on host occupancy.  
In cases where the host movement rate was either low enough that the pathogen was unable to persist or high enough to cause a pandemic, Hess found that further increasing movement increased host occupancy, while at intermediate levels that resulted in endemic disease, increasing movement decreased host occupancy.
These three scenarios, distinguished in \cite{Hess1996} by the host movement rate, map to the the three scenarios we outline here based on pathogen traits (disease-induced mortality and direct and environmental transmission).
The conceptual similarity of these results suggests more generally that in metapopulations facing intermediate (i.e. endemic) pathogen spread, factors that would normally increase host stability and connectivity in the absence of disease (e.g. increased movement, high quality habitat) can actually decrease total host population size as a result of increased pathogen spread.

However, we find that as the environmental longevity of the pathogen increases, the region in which we observe this reversal becomes smaller, that is, high quality habitat is a net benefit for a larger range of potential pathogens (Fig~\ref{highvlow}, red region grows from panels a. to c.).
Environmentally long-lived pathogens are able to spread widely for a larger range of conditions, largely overwhelming the ability of low quality habitat to provide refuges for susceptible hosts. 
These dynamics reflect the findings of \cite{Gog2002}, who found that under strong background infection from an alternative host, increasing movement always increased total occupancy, despite facilitating pathogen spread.  
Park (\cite{Park2012}) expanded on this by adding environmental transmission to the mix and found that in cases where background and environmental transmission were strong relative to direct transmission, increasing movement was again a net benefit to the host metapopulation.  
These studies, coupled with the results presented here, suggest that when there is a persistent source of infection throughout the metapopulation (e.g. from long-lived environmental reservoirs), factors that facilitate metapopulation stability (e.g. increased movement, high quality habitat) are generally a greater benefit than factors that inhibit pathogen spread (e.g. decreased movement, low quality habitat). 

The different scenarios and pathogens explored here represent a broad sample of the metapopulation dynamics that we might expect to observe in empirical systems.
The consistent patterns in the relative benefit of low and high quality habitat as a function of pathogen traits suggest that these trade-offs between metapopulation stability and pathogen spread are likely to be fairly general.  
By evaluating the relative importance of direct versus environmental transmission, along with the effect of habitat quality on connectivity and extinction, we can begin to diagnose where empirical systems (e.g. plague in prairie dogs, or white nose syndrome in bats) fall on this spectrum and the corresponding consequences for management.
As we have seen, failing to consider the characteristics of a pathogen and their effect on the roles played by high and low quality habitat risks overlooking the importance of low-quality habitat for the persistence of wildlife populations and the importance of high-quality habitat for the persistence of wildlife disease.

Panel columns show low (0.3, a, d), medium (1.0, b, e), and high (3.2, c, f) pathogen longevities, while rows show the effect of preferential selection of high quality habitat (a-c, $\xi_{im} = 0$,  no preference; d-f, $\xi_{im} = 0.5$, preference for high quality). The bottom row demonstrates the existence of an ecological trap on high quality habitat resulting from the fitness costs of increased disease risk. (PCC: delete sentence goes in the main text, but it also isn't clear to me how you derive this conclusion from the figure) Black points show the median over 100 replicate simulations, while vertical lines show the outer-quartile range, and gray points indicate outliers. Disease induced mortality and probability of direct infection fixed at $\nu = 0.2$ and $\delta = 0.3$. PCC: you can scale y to be the same across all plots, which would allow you to drop your y axes on col 2 \& 3, same goes for dropping the x axis on row 1 and squishing it together. Again, I would lable on the plot itself how longevity runs acroll the columns and rows indicate preference. If your main intent of the figure is to compare zero vs. high preference, then you should have those 2 cases on the same plot (maybe as two lines, dropping the boxplots) rather than making the reader make this connection across plots. The information in the boxplot seems to distract, rather than contribute, to your message here. }

\caption{Probability of host extinction as a function of pathogen environmental longevity and habitat preference, with black showing no habitat preference ($\xi_{im} = 0$) and red showing preference for high quality habitat ($\xi_{im} = 0.5$).  Disease induced mortality and probability of direct infection fixed at $\nu = 0.2$ and $\delta = 0.3$.  The combination of preference for high quality habitat and an environmentally long-lived pathogen serve to substantially increase extinction risk.  (PCC: seems like you could say this in text w/o using a figure since you have only 6 points here and only 2 of them are different....i.e. The probability of host extinction was ten times higher when there was a preference for high quality patches and longer environmental persistence (0.3 vs. 0.03))}
